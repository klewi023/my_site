        <p>Hello! My name is Katherine Lewis. I am in my final year of a BSBA in Enterprise Cybersecurity.</p>
        <p>I am a local to the Norfolk area. </p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <h3>How much do you know about JavaScript, HTML, and PHP?<h3>
        <p>I know very little about any of these languages but I do have some basic ideas.</p>
        <h3>How much do you know about databases such as MYSQL?<h3>
        <p>This is also unknown and new territory for me. Looking forward to this summer course.</p>
